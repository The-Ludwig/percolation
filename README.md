Percolation HTML 5 SVG
===

[Live Demo](https://the-ludwig.github.io/percolation/)

This is procastination on a different level.

This happened, while I wanted to learn for my statistical mechanics exam, where 
we analytically tackle the [2D-Percolation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory).
But I knew I wanted to learn the d3.js 
svg framework... (Thank you fireship.io).
